## GS instructions to open up a demo application

1. Open MPLAB X IDE
1. Open the demo application's `.X` folder as a project in MPLAB X IDE
1. Prepare your local MCC Content Manager to be able to open a project in the MPLAB Code Configurator:
    1. Click the blue "CM" shield icon to open the "MCC Content Manager". 
    1. Click "Load Manifest" button. 
    1. Navigate to the `harmony-manifest-success.yml` file at `eRCaGuy_MPLABX/PIC32MZ_EF_2.0_Curiosity/demo_apps/getting_started_extended_app/getting_started_ext/firmware/src/config/pic32mz_ef_curiosity_v2/harmony-manifest-success.yml`, or equivalent, and open it.
    1. On the blue "Apply" button, click the dropdown. Review the changes, and click "Apply". 
        1. This updates your locally-selected Harmony packages to be prepared to configure the project. 
    1. Click the little X at the top-right of the "MCC Content Manager" tab to close the MCC Content Manager.  
1. Open the MPLAB Code Configurator v5: Tools --> Embedded --> "MPLAB Code Configurator v5: Open/Close"
    1. Some windows may open up, asking about fixing paths and stuff. Accept the new paths. Ex: from Windows paths using `\` to Linux paths using `/`. 
    1. IT WORKS! YAAAY! It opens!
    1. You'll now see this Project Graph tab: 
        1. [![MPLAB_Code_Configurator_Project_Graph.jpg](GS_images/MPLAB_Code_Configurator_Project_Graph.jpg)](GS_images/MPLAB_Code_Configurator_Project_Graph.jpg)
1. In the "Project Graph" tab, click the "Plugins" dropdown menu to configure other peripherals. 
    1. _Tip:_ if you accidentally close the "Project Graph" tab, you can re-open it by going to Window --> "MPLAB Code Configurator v5" --> "Show All".
1. When done, I think you're supposed to generate code as follows:
    1. Go to the "Resource Management (MCC)" tab in the far top-left (near the normal "Projects" and "Files" tabs) --> go to the "Project Resources" tab --> click the "Generate" button.
1. Close the MPLAB Code Configurator v5: Tools --> Embedded --> "MPLAB Code Configurator v5: Open/Close". 
1. Done, I think. The tutorial video doesn't talk about nor show this really important step at all. The video tutorial is too superficial.
