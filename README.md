    1. Starter kit: https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_Engineering/tree/main/Datasheets/Microchip/PIC32MZ2048EFM144/embedded_starter_kit

Using this dev kit: https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/dm320007-c, the `eRCaGuy_MPLABX/harmony_projects/firmware/harmony_test1.X` project works! 

Harmony is no longer supported. See: https://forum.microchip.com/s/topic/a5C3l000000BoKjEAK/t390653

Solution: 
1. Download this git repo manually: https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/mhc

    Ex:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/dev/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony
    cd ~/dev/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony
    git clone https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/mhc.git
    ```

1. In MPLAB X IDE v6.15, go to Tools --> Options --> Plugins --> ensure that "Harmony Repository" is set to https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony, and that the "Harmony Content Path" is set to the path you just created above: `~/dev/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony`.

1. Then, open the code configurator: Tools --> Embedded --> "MPLAB Code Configurator v5: Open/Close"

1. Then follow the steps in the video above (more or less--they don't match quite right).

    Under pin settings, the UART pin should be pin 14: RG6: set it to `U6TX`. 

    Connect a USB serial UART ("console cable") to the dev kit, and connect it to your computer. Refer to DS70005230B, the start kit User's Guide, Table 2-3 p20. 

    - UART GND to dev kit GND (pin 6)
    - UART Rx to dev kit Tx (pin 8)

    Now, program the dev kit from MPLAB X IDE v6.15, and open a serial terminal to your USB serial UART. I use the legacy Arduino IDE 1.8.19 Serial Monitor for this. 

    Here is the output!--with \~1 second delay between each line: 
    ```
    0: Hello World!
    1: Hello World!
    2: Hello World!
    3: Hello World!
    4: Hello World!
    5: Hello World!
    6: Hello World!
    7: Hello World!
    8: Hello World!
    9: Hello World!
    10: Hello World!
    11: Hello World!
    12: Hello World!
    13: Hello World!
    14: Hello World!
    15: Hello World!
    16: Hello World!
    17: Hello World!
    18: Hello World!
    19: Hello World!
    20: Hello World!
    21: Hello World!
    22: Hello World!
    23: Hello World!
    24: Hello World!
    ```


# TODO

Todo/next steps (not necessarily in this order): 

1. [ ] Get the device to blink some LEDs at fixed intervals too.
1. [ ] Study and configure the clocks. 
1. [ ] Obtain high-resolution timestamps via the core timer.
1. [ ] Study and configure some interrupts and ISRs. 
1. [ ] Study and configure the timers/counters, and use them for: 
    1. [ ] PWM
    1. [ ] Input capture
    1. [ ] Output compare
    1. [ ] driving servos
1. [ ] Study and configure some DMA.
1. [ ] Add C++. 
1. [ ] Configure the build flags; ex: `-std=gnu++20`, `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, etc.
1. [ ] Add FreeRTOS. 
1. [ ] Add an interactive CLI over serial. 
1. [ ] Improve the UART control to be more like Arduino, except do it better by overwriting the `printf()` function. All prints will be passed to a buffer, and a UART ISR will continually send what's in the buffer, just like in Arduino. If the buffer is full, `printf()` will block until the data is all printed, just like Arduino. 
1. [ ] Add an interactive CLI over telnet over Ethernet. 
1. [ ] Add a web server and have it host a web page.
1. [ ] Add Arduino-like libraries and functions. 
1. [ ] Add a `Makefile` to build from the command line. See: https://github.com/brunoleppe/PIC32-Project-Template
1. [ ] Build it using a custom-compiled XC32 compiler. See: https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/Microchip_XC32_Compiler
